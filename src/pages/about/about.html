    <h1>NoMoTS API Boilerplate</h1>
    <div class="description">
      <strong>NoMoTS is a Node.js API boilerplate, connected to MongoDB with Mongoose and implemented in Typescript.</strong><br><br>

      <div class="quote">The Progressive Web App you are currently using, called <a href="https://github.com/maninak/NoMoTS-webapp" target="_blank">NoMoTS-webapp</a>, serves as an example front-end to interact with a deployed instance of the demo API included in the NoMoTS API boilerplate.</div><br><br>
      
      <strong>NoMoTS API</strong> provides the rich custom tooling needed for node + Typescript development from the get-go. It features support for development, production and test environments and an automatic versioning system following the SemVer specification. Moreover it includes an example CRUD implementation of a simple demo API of Company documents, paired with its integration and unit tests, among numerous other goodies.<br><br>

      All source code is littered with comments to help you understand what's going on and show you the way forward. If you already have experience with express.js you should feel right at home, only with less doubts and fear of touching the code due to the confidence boost that typings can provide.<br><br>
